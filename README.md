Pandora is now an open-source project allowing to control different agents (Windows & Linux machine) from server(s) and master.

---
## Features

- **Auto-Updater**
    - This RAT updates automatically each time the computer starts so that you (remote) can update all agents at the same time
- **Auto-Start**
    - The agent launches on the PC automatically each time the OS is started
- **Download other file with the agent**
    - When the victim launches the file for the first time, you can make sure to launch a real other program at the same time to make it more believable (for example a video game)
- **Encryption**
    - All data between agents, servers, masters is encrypted so that no one can read the content
- **AV Bypass**
    - As you can see, the virus is not detected by any antivirus on VT (nor on victim machines)
- **Botnet Attack**
    - You can carry out massive attacks on websites: the power of the attack will mainly depend on your number of victims (to give you an idea, with 750-1000 victims you can crash some big Russian government sites)
- **Chrome & Opera Stealer**
    - Information that Google Chrome and Opera saves on victims' computers can be recovered
- **Remote Desktop**
    - You can see victim's screens as well as control their computer
- **Remote Camera**
    - This module allows you to see the camera (if the person has one) of your victim
- **Keylogger**
    - This allows you to recover all keystrokes (including passwords and sensitive information)
- **Discord Token Grabber**
    - Discord account tokens are necessarily stored on the PC of a user with Discord. This grabber grabs tokens from any version of Discord (Normal, Canary, PTB, Dev etc) as well as in browsers
- **FileManager**
    - You will be able to delete, download and browse files from a remote computer
- **Process Manager**
    - You can see all the programs running on the computer and you can close the ones you want
- **Ransomware**
    - Encrypting files on all disks with a specific algorithm
- **Shell**
    - Allows to execute shell commands (as administrator)
 - **And more**
	- Persistence
